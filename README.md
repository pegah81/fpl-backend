# fpl-backend
Summer (2022) internship project (Fantasy Premier League)
In this project we created a model  of the Fantasy Premier League website, with a full frontend using ReactJS and an Android application.
The code uploaded here is only the backend of this project, which was built using the MongoDB database and NodeJS. 
We tried to apply the best architecture we knew of and improved the architecture a few times during the project.
